# Powers of Zen — project orientation (read this first)

This file is the durable "read me first" for anyone (Claude or Phil) picking the project
up in a fresh session. Nothing important should live only in a conversation. Deep detail
lives in `PLAN.md`; this file is the map and the mental models.

## What this is
An agent-assisted pipeline that produces and posts **"Powers of Ten"-style continuous-zoom
short videos** — seamless looping dives through morphing worlds across every scale of the
universe (city → cosmos → quantum → back). Brand: **Powers of Zen**, on TikTok, YouTube
Shorts, Instagram (all @powersofzen / powers.of.zen). Goal: followers. It's an ATTENTION
project, not a science project — loose science as awe-garnish, visuals maximized.
Everything runs LOCAL and FREE on Phil's RTX 3080 (no paid APIs).

## The mental models we've settled on (the "why", learned the hard way)
- **Three-layer format** (see PLAN.md): FORMAT (fixed signature — zoom/denoise schedules,
  10ⁿ counter, exact loop) / STYLE (checkpoint + palette deck) / JOURNEY (infinitely
  varied world-cards). Journeys are SLOT FILLERS compiled through fixed grammar templates,
  never raw prompts — this is what keeps infinite variety on-brand.
- **Build-IN, not build-out.** The engine dives inward (crop-and-reimagine); build-out
  (shrink+outpaint) was tested and REJECTED by Phil as "awful". Journeys authored
  LARGE→SMALL with next_target chains, CIRCULAR (last card targets first world).
- **Zoom, not morph.** ×10 per register, arrive→look→plunge pacing, targets named once,
  denoise low enough that structures persist. The whole engine exists to fight morph-feel.
- **Two seams, don't conflate:** the LOOP point (last frame = first, unavoidably at a cut)
  vs the EXOTIC WRAP (quark→cosmos). Phase-shift playback so both land mid-video and the
  opening is a stable macro-realm frame (scripts/phase_shift.py).
- **The cost lesson:** rendering is cheap (GPU work is OUTSIDE model context); browser
  posting is expensive (screenshots ACCUMULATE in context, cost compounds quadratically).
  Put work where it's cheap; keep images out of the accumulating context; delegate vision
  to subagents/local models. This drives the whole agent architecture (PLAN.md).

## Where things live
- `PLAN.md` — plan of record: all decisions, the end-to-end architecture, doctrines.
- `engine/dive.py` — the renderer (ComfyUI API feedback-zoom, counter, loop, cameos).
- `engine/grammar.py` — compiles world-card journeys → prompts + per-frame schedules.
- `journeys/*.json` — the world-card journeys (Layer 3). `journeys/VARIATIONS.md` — the
  differentiation library the Journey Composer draws from (Phil edits it directly).
- `scripts/` — phase_shift.py (intentional openings), zen_browser.py (CDP driver),
  start_chrome_zen.sh, overnight.sh (render batches), mascot_concepts.py.
- `output/<journey>/vN/` — renders (NEVER overwritten; finals at root, build/ = intermediates).
- `output/mascots/canon/` — the chosen mascot cast (hidden Waldo-style cameos, one per video).
- `review/` + `review_divein/` — phase-shifted cuts still IN REVIEW (zoom-out / dive-in).
- `production/` — chosen-model cuts of videos MARKED READY (queue.json points here).
  `production_alternates/` — the other-model counterpart. Promote via
  `scripts/promote.py <journey> <turbo|ds>` (the standard "approve" step).
- `outbox/queue.json` — the posting queue: file + title-caption + yt fields + approval gate.
- Every video gets a scale-matched mascot cameo (size ≥0.12, full-cast rotation) → the
  find-the-character caption. Music is a QUALITY priority: phase-dynamic (intensify on
  plunge, chill on hover), moving toward local MusiConGen — see PLAN.md.
- `.claude/skills/dive-video/` — how to make a video. `.claude/skills/zen-post/` — how to
  post one (the playbook the future local harness will execute).

## How to work on this
- Skills: invoke `/dive-video` to make/iterate a video, `/zen-post` to post (currently the
  playbook; being ported to a local harness). Follow the skill files — they encode hard-won
  authoring rules (no double-objects, creature chains don't nest, empty human interiors,
  vary cameos, never open on the exotic seam, etc.).
- ComfyUI must be up (`/mnt/c/Users/Phil/start_comfyui.sh`, API at localhost:8188). Ollama
  at 192.168.68.1:11434. ffmpeg is the Windows winget build (path in PLAN.md / engine).
- ALWAYS run python from the project root (module imports assume it). Use absolute paths.
- Commit source (not output/, review*, chrome_zen/ — all gitignored).

## Current state (update this line as it changes)
2026-07-27: LIVE on all 3 platforms; posts #1 (cosmic_scales) + #2 (midnight_kitchen)
up. Auto-posting HALTED (cost + approval gate). 10-video production list PROMOTED to
production/ (+ alternates). Fix batch rendering with cameos (skyfog/antenna_ball/
mineral_heart/cartographer). Next build: LOCAL posting harness (qwen3-vl:4b + moondream2),
then Streamlit dashboard + approval flow, then Journey Composer, then phase-dynamic music.
